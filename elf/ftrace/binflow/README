DISCLAIMER: This software sucks, I wrote it in about a day, and never finished it. The code base is terrible!
Feel free to use the code if it helps you, but realize that it was a half-baked prototype that I never completed.
The idea is to write a version of github.com/elfmaster/ftrace that sets breakpoints instead of singlestepping naively.
There is an even faster method which avoids the use of ptrace all together, and will be possible to write quite easily
once this ul_exec_trace debugging functionality is added into github.com/elfmaster/libelfmaster

With that said:

binflow v0.0.1

This software is a re-design of ftrace (https://github.com/elfmaster/ftrace)
which was somewhat popular but has some naive implementation qualities that
make it slow, and not suitable for some applications. 

binflow is much faster, and has better argument resolution and will be able
to handle multi-threaded applications/processes. Currently it is only 30%
complete and does not yet handle return values.

Stay tuned. Here is an example of binflow tracing a binary that was compiled
from the following source code:

int f(int a, int b, int c)
{
	printf("%d, %d, %d\n", a, b, c);
}

int main(void)
{
	int j = 0;
	int i;
	char *ptr = strdup("Hello");
	char buf[255];
	strncpy(buf, "hello", 8);
	printf("%s\n", buf);
	printf("%s\n", ptr);
	f(3, 2, 1);
	for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
		f(1 + i, 2, 3 + i);
}
