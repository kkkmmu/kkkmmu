In C, as in other compiled languages, the compiled code goes into the text segment, while the variables reside in the remaining segments. Exactly which memory segment a variable will be stored in depends on how the variable is defined. Variables that are defined outside of any functions are considered to be global. The static keyword can also be prepended to any variable declaration to make the variable static. If static or global variables are initialized with data, they are stored in the data memory segment; otherwise, these variables are put in the bss memory segment. Memory on the heap memory segment must first be allocated using a memory allocation function called malloc(). Usually, pointers are used to reference memory on the heap. Finally, the remaining function variables are stored in the stack memory segment. Since the stack can contain many different stack frames, stack variables can maintain uniqueness within different functional contexts.
