 Namespace
 Namespace is a necessary construct in any software project that involves a codebase that is larger than a few simple functions. Namespace provides scope to your identifiers and allows you to reuse naming conventions to make your code more readable and maintainable. In assembly language where subroutines are identified by global labels, namespace can be achieved by using local labels.

 Up until the last few tutorials we have been using global labels exclusively. This means that BLOCKS of logic that essentially perform the same task needed a label with a unique identifier. A good example would be our "finished" labels. These were global in scope meaning when we needed to break out of a loop in one function we could jump to a "finished" label. But if we needed to break out of a loop in a different function we would need to name this same task something else maybe calling it "done" or "continue". Being able to reuse the label "finished" would mean that someone reading the code would know that these BLOCKS of logic perform almost the same task.

 Local labels are prepended with a "." at the beginning of their name for example ".finished". You may have noticed them appearing as our code base in functions.asm grew. A local label is given the namespace of the first global label above it. You can jump to a local label by using the JMP instruction and the compiler will calculate which local label you are referencing by determining in what scope (based on the above global labels) the instruction was called.
