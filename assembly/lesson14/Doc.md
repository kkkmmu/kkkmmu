In this program we will be multiplying the value in EBX by the value present in EAX. Firstly we load EAX and EBX with integers in the same way as Lesson 12. This time though we will be calling the MUL instruction to perform our multiplication logic. The MUL instruction is different from many instructions in NASM, in that it only accepts one further argument. The MUL instruction always multiples EAX by whatever value is passed after it. The answer is left in EAX.
