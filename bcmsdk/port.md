1. When the packate ingresses the switch, it already has a physical port number associated with it. Then the chip should determin the packat processing port (PPP) and fetch the associaded configurations. 
    a. The ING_DEVICE_PORT table is indexed using the physical port number and used to determin the physical nature of the port(Cascaded, loopback, HiGig2 or Ethernet). 
    b. The properties associated with the system port are retreived from the LPORT_TABLE. In addition to fetching port related properties, this bolck is also responsible for fetching some gobal device properties held in the ING_CONFIG_64, MC_CONTROL_1, HG_PKT_SIGNATURE and CTRL_PKT_SIGNATURE registers as well for identifying packets.
